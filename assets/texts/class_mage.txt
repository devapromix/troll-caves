Mages have knowledge of ancient spells and can call upon the power
of the elements to help them. They are capable of dealing massive
damage to a large number of enemies, as well as slowing, pinning and
knocking back enemies. Magicians use staves and magical artifacts
as weapons, which give them strength and unity with the energy flows
of the world.
