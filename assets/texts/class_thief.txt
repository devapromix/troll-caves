Thieves specialize in one-on-one combat. They are capable of destroying
an enemy with a single attack, after immobilizing him with a sudden
stun or knocking him down. In addition, they have the ability to
increase critical strike chance and speed. A dagger in the hands of a
thief turns into a fast, deadly weapon that strikes enemies to the very
heart. And only thieves can safely pick locks and bypass traps.
