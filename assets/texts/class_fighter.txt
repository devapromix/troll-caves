Fighters are the most powerful class in the game. Thanks to strong
armor and a large amount of life, warriors are indispensable in
battles and can withstand the onslaught of the enemy for a long time.

hammer or axe. With their strong blows, they can cause damage to
several enemies at once, or they can focus on one.
