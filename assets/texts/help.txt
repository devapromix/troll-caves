You are a young adventurer who has entered the abandoned Old Temple in Lonely
Mountain. Many horror stories were told about this Temple at nighttime bonfires,
as well as stories about a Ruby Amulet that could grant great power to its wearer.
As an intrepid explorer, you grab your trusty weapon and enter the Old Temple to
find out what really lurks in its dark shadows. Use your wits to collect items to
explore the levels of the Old Temple. However, be aware that many dangers await you.
Good luck! You will need it...
